Performs the same as ByteCounter (the unmodified version) except that the program can be run
without using a batch file by simply double clicking on the jar. Because there is no command
line interface to use, the program will use the parent directory for calculating memory stored
and will output into a textfile all of the information that ByteCounter provides, that is
Total bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and elapsed time. Added bonus of wall-of-text
readme.

Since chances are you're only using this one if you need to avoid batch files or command line
interfaces, a jarfile has been provided, no domestic compiling necessary.
